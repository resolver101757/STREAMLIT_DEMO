# STREAMLIT_DEMO

Some scripts testing out the streamlit app

First_app.py shows a bunch of objects thrown onto the website 
take_a_picture.py draws boundries around a still photo teken on the webcam (or what ever is the default camera)
open_cv_face_detection _video.py is simular take_a_picture.py but shows it in a video 


haarcascades folder has different opencv face detection parameters 

The openCV was taken from this article : https://towardsdatascience.com/computer-vision-for-beginners-part-3-79de62dbeef7
